## Introduction
This is a code repository for my 3D portfolio website inspired by ForrestKnight's code - https://youtu.be/f_ZxgQQ74Lc.

I built myself a developer portfolio website to showcase my experience and skillset. I was deeply inspired by the asethetic of ForrestKnight's website and the design elements of his code. This project mimic's ForrestKnight's original website and maintains an intuitive design through the following: three.js 3D graphics, interactive animations, and parallax. ForrestKnight's code had a problem with parallax which I have attempted to rectify.
